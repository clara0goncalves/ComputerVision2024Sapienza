**Project Proposal:** Object and Lane Detection for embedded devices

**Problem Description:**
Real-time applications such as autonomous driving in embedded devices have presented a challenge to get the same accuracy on these low resource devices. This project has as main goal to try to create an application that is able to achieve optimal accuracy in real-time embedded devices like the Jetson Nano. It will try to achieve that by developing an optimized model and application for object and lane detection.

**Overview of Solutions:**
The proposed project aims to develop an application for object and lane detection that is able to work on low resources, such as Jetson or CPU devices. The plan strategies are: 

- Model Optimization.
- Algorithmic Efficiency.
- Data Augmentation and Preprocessing.
- Hybrid Approaches between deep learning and computer vision approaches.

**Data Plan:**
Open source datasets from KITTI, Robofllow or Apollo will be used for training object and lane detection models.
