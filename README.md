**Project Proposal:** Object and Lane Detection for embedded devices

**Problem Description:**
Real-time applications such as autonomous driving in embedded devices have presented a challenge to get the same accuracy on these low resource devices. This project has as main goal to try to create an application that is able to achieve optimal accuracy in real-time embedded devices like the Jetson Nano. It will try to achieve that by developing an optimized model and application for object and lane detection.

This project also aims to discuss the solution of merging the strategies of knoledge destilation, quantization and prunning and what could be obtained by combining these different efficiency methodologies? Which of these is most influential? And does the order of applying the solutions affect the ouptut?

**Overview of Solutions:**
The proposed project aims to develop an application for object and lane detection that is able to work on low resources, such as Jetson or CPU devices. The plan strategies are: 

- Model Optimization.
- Algorithmic Efficiency.
- Data Augmentation and Preprocessing.
- Hybrid Approaches between deep learning and computer vision approaches.
